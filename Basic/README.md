# What is javascript
* JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged 
  programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
# Feactures of javascript
* All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
* JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
* JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
* JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
* It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
* It is a case-sensitive language.
* JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
* It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
# Application of javascript
* Client-side validation,
* Dynamic drop-down menus,
* Displaying date and time,
* Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
* Displaying clocks etc.
# Places to put JavaScript code
* Between the body tag of html
* Between the head tag of html
* In .js file (external javaScript)
# Advantages of External JavaScript
  There will be following benefits if a user creates an external javascript:
* It helps in the reusability of code in more than one HTML file.
* It allows easy code readability.
* It is time-efficient as web browsers cache the external js files, which further reduces the page loading time.
* It enables both web designers and coders to work with html and js files parallelly and separately, i.e., without facing any code conflictions.
* The length of the code reduces as only we need to specify the location of the js file.
# Disadvantages of External JavaScript
  There are the following disadvantages of external files:
* The stealer may download the coder's code using the url of the js file.
* If two js files are dependent on one another, then a failure in one file may affect the execution of the other dependent file.
* The web browser needs to make an additional http request to get the js code.
* A tiny to a large change in the js code may cause unexpected results in all its dependent files.
* We need to check each file that depends on the commonly created external javascript file.
* If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal javascript code.
