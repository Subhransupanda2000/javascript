# Variables
* A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
  There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
* A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global 
  variable.
* To declare JavaScript global variables inside function, you need to use window object. For example:window.value=90;  
* When you declare a variable outside the function, it is added in the window object internally. You can access it through window object also. For 
  example:alert(window.value);//accessing global variable
*
