# Variables
* A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.
  There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).
* A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global 
  variable.
* To declare JavaScript global variables inside function, you need to use window object. For example:window.value=90;  
* When you declare a variable outside the function, it is added in the window object internally. You can access it through window object also. For 
  example:alert(window.value);//accessing global variable
# Global variable
* Variable which is acessable throughout the program function and object that is global variable.
* ex- var we can acess it through window object
* But in the case of const and let if we will decler globally it will act as global variable but we can not acss through window object
# What is void 0 (Void Zero) in JavaScript?
* The expression void 0 in JavaScript is used to explicitly produce undefined. It is a shorthand way to guarantee the value of undefined, regardless of whether the global undefined variable has been modified (in * * older JavaScript environments).
# Purpose of JSON.stringify() in JavaScript
* JSON.stringify() is a method in JavaScript that converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string. It is commonly used for serializing data, meaning turning a JavaScript object into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or written as a string.
